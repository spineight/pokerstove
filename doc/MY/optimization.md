the pokerstove library I am using for my project for equity evaluation in a Texas Holdem poker at 6 players table is super slow, and even on flop it takes it ages to finish. I have included the source code to show how I use it.
The question is: what speedup techniques we can apply to make sure equity is calculated within seconds rather than hours ?
```

I have invited the following experts to discuss speedup techniques for the equity calculation using the Pokerstove library in your project:

Dr. Alice Peterson - Expert in algorithm optimization and computational complexity.
Dr. Bob Smith - Specialist in parallel computing and high-performance computing.
Dr. Clara Thompson - Experienced in game theory and poker strategy development.
Dr. David Brown - Expert in machine learning and probabilistic methods in gaming.
Dr. Eva Green - Specialist in software engineering with a focus on efficient data structures.
Each expert will briefly provide ideas on how to speed up the equity calculation.

Expert Ideas
1. Dr. Alice Peterson: Algorithm Optimization

1.1: Optimize the enumeration process by pruning unpromising branches early.
1.2: Implement memoization to cache and reuse previously computed results.
1.3: Use more efficient data structures like hash maps for quick lookup.
2. Dr. Bob Smith: Parallel Computing

2.1: Utilize multi-threading to parallelize the equity calculation process.
2.2: Leverage GPU computing to offload intensive computations to the GPU.
2.3: Distribute the workload across multiple machines if possible.
3. Dr. Clara Thompson: Game Theory Strategies

3.1: Simplify the hand evaluation by focusing only on the most probable scenarios.
3.2: Use heuristic-based approaches to estimate equity rather than exhaustive enumeration.
3.3: Implement adaptive algorithms that adjust the depth of calculation based on the stage of the game.
4. Dr. David Brown: Probabilistic Methods

4.1: Use Monte Carlo simulations with a smaller number of iterations for faster, approximate results.
4.2: Apply Bayesian methods to update equity estimates as new information is revealed.
4.3: Employ importance sampling to focus on the most critical parts of the probability distribution.
5. Dr. Eva Green: Efficient Software Engineering

5.1: Profile the code to identify and optimize bottlenecks.
5.2: Refactor the code for better memory management and reduce unnecessary data copying.
5.3: Implement lazy evaluation to delay computations until they are absolutely necessary.
